# micro:bit
[ CURRENTLY A WORK-IN-PROGRESS]

This project will demonstrate how to build a simple mobile differential robot using the
commonly available [micro:bit board](https://microbit.org/). I wish I had one of these
boards when I was a kid. They are just chock full of sensors and a powerful processor
to run it all.

In addition to the micro:bit board, more hardware will be required in order to build the
robot. Below is a shopping list (with links) for the items this project will use. I've
endeavored to keep the cost under $100 US dollars, including the micro:bit board. Most
of the items are sourced through [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/) as it makes it
easier to get everything from one place. I don't get any kickbacks from Sparkfun, I
just think they are a great source for electronic and robotic components, and they
have almost everything you need for this project. You are free to buy these parts from
someplace else. Some are specific to Sparkfun (like the motor driver), so if you
substitute for something else you'll probably need to do some extra work (but that is
always part of the fun!). [Prices are as of Feb 17 2023]

- [micro:bit kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17288) - In case you don't already
  have a micro:bit, this kit will get you started. ($18.50)
- [micro:bit breadboard breakout](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08HZBRGWN) - This
  will make it easier to access the micro:bit pins and intergrate it with the many other
  connections we will need for the other components. ($6.99)
- [breadboard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12615) - If you don't already have a
  breadboard, this is a nice one to have. We will need a single full size breadboard
  for this project. ($6.50)
- [jumper wires](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14284) - To go with the breadboard,
  we will use these to connect the components together. ($2.75)
- [motors](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13302) - This is a pair of inexpensive
  hobby motors that will be used for the robot. ($5.50)
- [wheels](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13259) - Some basic wheels that attach to
  the motors. ($3.50)
- [wheel encoder kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12629) - These encoders can
  be added to the motors to sense how far the wheels have turned. ($13.95)
- [motor driver](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14450) - This sinple motor driver
  powers the motors and allows for speed and direction control. ($9.95)
- [battery holder](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12083) - A battery holder for 4
  AA batteries that will provide 6 volts to power the motors and the micro:bit.
  ($2.10)
- [3.3v power regulator](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18356) - We need to reduce
  the 6 volts from the battery to 3.3 volts for the micro:bit. ($5.50)
